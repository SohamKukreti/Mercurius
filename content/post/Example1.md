## Events Round the Year:-
Our community is vibrant and active, hosting a variety of events that served different interests. From workshops and hackathons to meetups and conferences, our aim is to create engaging opportunities for learning and collaborations in OSS. Let's highlight some of the standout events that shaped our community.

### CTF (Unmasking the world of cybersecurity challenges)
OSDC also demystified the practices of cybersecurity and explored the labyrinth of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. We introduce you to the world of digital security and learn how to develop our skills with the help of CTFs. When it came to cybersecurity, most of us are beginners and felt intimidated by the intricacies of technology.

### Introduction to OSS
Have you ever wondered how you could become a part of this dynamic world, harness your skills, and contribute to the future of software? We talked about the power of open-source software (OSS). With a guided career talk and QnA session at the end, we aimed to empower you to make your mark on the software landscape.

### Git/Github Workshop
We learn how to tame the wild branches, cast spells with commits, and merge with the wisdom of a thousand wizards. GitHub, the land of collaboration, is our trusty sidekick on this journey.

### OSDHack
OSDHack is an online hackathon organized by the Open Source Developers Community of JIIT, Noida. It is a 48-hour long gathering of like-minded hackers and tech enthusiasts where participants brainstormed and built on their ideas.

### LINUX Meetup
Come, delve into the realms of this ocean with our very own Open Source Developers Community. From gaining insights into the world of Linux to exploring ways to become a better developer.

### Google Summer of Code (GSOC)
OSDC going to conduct a session on the 21st of November to spread awareness about Google Summer of Code (GSOC). We are thrilled to bring together enthusiasts, developers, and potential contributors to discuss the incredible opportunities GSOC offered.

### Code Jam
This is something you might have been asking yourself. A Code Jam ia a chance to create something with a team. You are paired up with a group of other participants just like yourself with whom you collaborated and made a project on a given theme. You then had around a week's time to create the best project you could. See Format for detailed information.
